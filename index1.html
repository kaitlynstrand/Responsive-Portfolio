      <p> Hi Everyone! My name is Kaitlyn. I just started Coding Bootcamp at Northwestern as I am in the middle of a big career change. I went to the University of Notre Dame where I studied Finance and was captain of the cheerleading team. After graduation, I moved to New York City where I worked at a fintech company named Dealerweb before moving to a trading desk at BNP Paribas. I helped my clients trade equities, options and futures electronically via algorithms.</p>

      <br>
  
      <p>I just moved back to the city of Chicago and I am looking forward to the next phase of my life. I am happy to be close to my family again, who live in the Northwest suburbs. Currently, I am also completing my application for the University of Chicago's masters program in Computer Analytics in Public Policy. I would like to work for the City of Chicago in either their budget office and help reconstruct their finances. Wish me luck!</p>
